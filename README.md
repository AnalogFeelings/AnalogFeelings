### Hi!!! Im Analog Feelings, but you can call me Nora.

I'm a programmer girl who loves C#, messing around with Windows components and old computers.  
I've completely lost sensitivity to caffeine unless it's in extremely high doses, I love Monster.

People used to know me as AestheticalZ or AestheticalGL.
